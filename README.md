# XHRISTIAN Community Wiki

Welcome to the community documentation space for the $XHRISTIAN project.

This wiki provides narrative context, background information, and community-oriented documentation related to the project.

---

## What This Project Is

$XHRISTIAN is a public, on-chain token accompanied by open documentation and an evolving community narrative.

Ownership of the token represents participation in an open-ended cultural and symbolic project rather than access to a defined product or utility.

---

## Pre-Launch Status

The token has not yet been launched.

This wiki currently exists to:
- Document the project’s intent and context
- Set expectations around participation
- Provide a public record as the project develops

Content will evolve as the project moves from pre-launch to live operation.

---

## Participation

Community participation is informal and voluntary.

There are no guarantees, roadmaps, or promised outcomes.  
All engagement is based on individual interest and interpretation.

## About This Wiki

This space is maintained in public and may change over time as the project evolves.
